# Arr Suit Cleanup Script

This script checks for failed downloads in a download client and marks them as failed in [Sonarr](https://github.com/Sonarr/Sonarr) and [Radarr](https://github.com/Radarr/Radarr). It ensures that unavailable media is properly blocked or removed based on configurable conditions such as availability, time since added, and active hours. The script is particularly useful for automating media management by cleaning up failed downloads and ensuring that they are handled in your media library.

## Features

- Automatically identifies downloads that have stalled or are missing pieces.
- Marks corresponding episodes in Sonarr or movies in Radarr as failed.
- Removes downloads from download client based on customizable conditions.
- Configurable settings for availability, active time, and more.
- Log output for detailed tracking of the script's actions.

## Requirements

- Radarr and/or Sonarr instance with API enabled
- Python 3.x
- `requests` library
- Download client (e.g., qbittorent) with API enabled

## Setup

1. Clone the repository or download the script.
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install requests
   ```
3. Configure the script by editing the following parameters inside the script:

   - **Download client configuration:**

     ```python
     QB_URL = "http://localhost:8090/api/v2/"  # Update with your download client URL
     QB_USER = "admin"                         # Replace with your download client username
     QB_PASSWORD = "changeme"                  # Replace with your download client password
     ```

   - **Sonarr Configuration:**

     ```python
     SONARR_ENABLED = True
     SONARR_URL = "http://xxx.xxx.x.xxx:8989/api/v3/"
     SONARR_API_KEY = "API_KEY"                # Replace with your Sonarr API key
     ```

   - **Radarr Configuration:**
     ```python
     RADARR_ENABLED = True
     RADARR_URL = "http://xxx.xxx.x.xxx:7878/api/v3/"
     RADARR_API_KEY = "API_KEY"                # Replace with your Radarr API key
     ```

4. Customize behavior by setting the following parameters:

   - **Downloads Removal:**

     ```python
     QB_ALWAYS_REMOVE = False   # Always remove failed downloads, regardless of Sonarr or Radarr check
     QB_REMOVE_IF_KNOWN = True  # Only remove failed downloads if found in Sonarr or Radarr
     ```

   - **Downloads Filtering:**
     ```python
     MIN_AVAILABILITY = 1.0     # Minimum availability threshold (Recommended: 1.0 for 100%)
     MIN_ACTIVE_HOURS = 24      # Minimum active time before considering availability (e.g., 24 hours)
     MIN_ADDED_HOURS = 0        # Minimum time since downloads was added (e.g., 0 hours)
     ```

## How It Works

1. The script authenticates with the download client using the provided credentials.
2. It retrieves the list of downloads and filters for stalled or failed downloads based on availability and time conditions.
3. It checks whether the failed downloads corresponds to an episode in Sonarr or a movie in Radarr:
   - For Sonarr, it uses the downloads title to parse and search for the episode.
   - For Radarr, it looks up the movie using the downloads title.
4. If a corresponding episode or movie is found, the script marks the item as failed in Sonarr or Radarr.
5. Optionally, the download can be removed from download client based on the specified conditions.

## Logs

The script logs all actions and decisions in a log file named `arrCleanUp.log`, including:

- Authentication status
- Failed downloads found
- Media matched in Sonarr or Radarr
- Actions taken (marked as failed, removed from download client)

## Usage

Run the script via command line:

```bash
python script.py
```

### Cron Job

To automate the script, set up a cron job to run it at regular intervals. For example, to run the script every 6 hours, use the following command:

```bash
0 */6 * * * /usr/bin/python3 /path/to/script.py
```

## Troubleshooting

- Ensure that Sonarr and Radarr are accessible via the provided URLs and API keys.
- Check the arrCleanUp.log for detailed logs of the scriptâ€™s operations. You can also change the log level to DEBUG for more detailed output (eg. level=logging.DEBUG).
- Verify that download client is running and the API is enabled in its settings.
